Stuck your computer in ease!

# What is it?
a stupid video player with only sound output. Can only play mp4 and flv format videos.

# How to use it?
Really simple. Just compile it and then execute it and drag a file into it then you're done.
Also, if you want to have a try, drag the video file into it multiple times, and you will get stuck easily lol.

# Advanced Settings
The video will play once every 0.01 seconds, to adjust the setting, go to the source code and find for a variable called "waittime". Follow the comment to adjust the time.

# Updates
This is the first version and ALSO the last version of the stupid player. Any pull requests will be check, but may not be accept.

# Annotation for the code
I copied it from the internet and give some little adjustment. I forget the link to the source code. If you think the code is mainly yours, contact grieferpig@163.com and give me proof. I will delete it immidiately. Sorry for that.
